# tunein
a minimal live radio station for students to study to, and interact with strangers

this was made in 10 minutes at 2:30am EST so ngl i don't know whats on here, i just know it works. gonna add more and more radios once i get my stations up and running

all radio stations besides LoFi are owned and streamed by me, and its a one way radio, i do not receive data from you listening to the radios or accessing the page.
